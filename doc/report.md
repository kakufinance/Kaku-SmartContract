# Low Issues

## L-1: Centralization Risk for trusted owners

Contracts have owners with privileged rights to perform admin tasks and need to be trusted to not perform malicious updates or drain funds.

## L-2: Missing checks for `address(0)` when assigning values to address state variables

Check for `address(0)` when assigning values to address state variables.

<details><summary>1 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/ClaimKAKU.sol [Line: 38](src/ClaimKAKU.sol#L38)

	```solidity
	        token = _token;
	```

</details>



## L-3: PUSH0 is not supported by all chains

Solc compiler version 0.8.20 switches the default target EVM version to Shanghai, which means that the generated bytecode will include PUSH0 opcodes. Be sure to select the appropriate EVM version in case you intend to deploy on a chain other than mainnet like L2 chains that may not support PUSH0, otherwise deployment of your contracts will fail.

## L-4: Large literal values multiples of 10000 can be replaced with scientific notation

Use `e` notation, for example: `1e18`, instead of its full numeric value.
